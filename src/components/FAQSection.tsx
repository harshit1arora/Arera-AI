    question: "How long does it take to integrate Arera APIs?",
    answer: "Most engineering teams are up and running in our sandbox environment within a few hours. A full production rollout typically takes under a week thanks to our deterministic API structure and comprehensive documentation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Arera handle RBI compliance?",
    answer: "Yes. Our infrastructure is designed to be strictly aligned with RBI's 2022 Digital Lending Guidelines. We provide immutable audit trails and per-decision explainability required for regulatory filing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we use our own custom underwriting logic?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You can configure custom deterministic rules and guardrails. You have full control over the rule sequence and risk thresholds.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a bureau is down?",
    answer: "Arera features built-in fallback mechanisms. If a primary bureau times out, we can instantly pivot to a secondary bureau or lean on bank statement transaction patterns to ensure your flow doesn't hang.",
  },
  {
    question: "How secure is user data?",
    answer: "We utilize industry-standard encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. We maintain a strict data localization policy in compliance with RBI mandates.",
  },
