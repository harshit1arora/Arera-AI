        `If you earn a net take-home salary of ₹${sl} per month, your estimated maximum personal loan limit is approximately ${fmtINR(maxLoan)}. This is calculated based on standard Indian banking guidelines where your total monthly EMIs (FOIR) cannot exceed 40–50% of your income.`,
        `At this salary level, your maximum monthly EMI capacity is ${fmtINR(maxEmi)}. Lenders like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Bajaj Finserv use this limit to compute the highest loan amount they can offer you.`,
        `Key factors that determine your actual loan limit beyond salary:`,
        `• Employer Tier: Working at a high-profile corporate (Tier-A MNC or listed company) lowers underwriting risk and increases your eligibility significantly.`,
        `• CIBIL Score: Lenders require a minimum of 650+; a score of 750+ unlocks the lowest interest rates starting from 10.5% p.a.`,
        `• Existing Liabilities: Any active EMIs (car loan, home loan, credit card minimums) directly reduce your net disposable income and lower the approved loan amount.`,
        `• Job Stability: At least 1 year with your current employer (6 months for some NBFCs) is typically required.`,
        `Tips to maximize your loan limit on a ₹${sl} salary:`,
        `• Pay off outstanding credit card balances to reduce your Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio before applying.`,
        `• Opt for a longer repayment tenure (up to 60 or 72 months) to lower your EMI threshold and qualify for a higher principal.`,
        `• Submit 6 months of continuous salary credits in your bank statement without cash withdrawals, cheque bounces, or mandate failures.`,

        { q: `What is the maximum loan amount on a ₹${sl} salary?`, a: `You can typically get a personal loan of up to ${fmtINR(maxLoan)} depending on your credit history, employer classification, and existing EMIs. Banks apply the FOIR rule, capping total EMIs at 40–50% of your income.` },
        { q: `How do banks calculate EMI eligibility for ₹${sl}/month salary?`, a: `Banks use the Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR) method, capping your total monthly EMIs at ${fmtINR(maxEmi)} — approximately 45% of your take-home salary. This is the maximum EMI amount they will approve.` },
        { q: `Which bank gives the highest loan on a ₹${sl} salary?`, a: `HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Bajaj Finserv typically offer the highest loan multiples on salary. SBI and PNB offer competitive rates. Your final eligibility depends on your CIBIL score and employer tier.` },
        { q: `Can I get a personal loan on ₹${sl} salary with a low CIBIL score?`, a: `Yes, but prime banks (HDFC, ICICI, SBI) will likely reject. Fintech NBFCs like MoneyTap, KreditBee, or Navi approve borrowers with scores above 600 but charge higher interest rates of 18–24%.` },

        `• High FOIR Ratio: Your total monthly EMIs (including credit card minimums) exceed 50% of your net monthly income. This is the single most common rejection reason.`,
        `• Low CIBIL Score: A score below 680 triggers automatic rejection. Between 680–720, it depends on your employer tier and income level.`,
        `• Multiple Recent Credit Inquiries: Applying to 3+ lenders within 30 days signals credit hunger and drops your score by 5–10 points per inquiry.`,
        `• Bank Statement Irregularities: ECS/NACH mandate bounces, frequent overdrafts, or large unexplained cash withdrawals in the last 6 months.`,
        `• Employer Blacklisting: ${bankName} maintains internal lists of employers considered high risk. Employees of blacklisted firms face higher rejection rates or reduced eligibility.`,
        `• Insufficient Employment History: Less than 6 months at current employer, or job gaps in the last 12 months, raises underwriting risk.`,
        `• Existing Default or Settlement: Any active DPD (Days Past Due) or loan settlement in the CIBIL report from the last 3–5 years.`,
        `How to fix your profile and reapply to ${bankName}:`,
        `• Wait 3–6 months after rejection to let your CIBIL recover from the hard inquiry.`,
        `• Pay off existing credit card balances to reduce your FOIR ratio.`,
        `• Maintain 6 consecutive months of clean bank statements (zero bounces, regular salary credits).`,
        `• If your employer is blacklisted, consider applying to NBFCs like Bajaj Finserv or MoneyTap first to build a repayment track record.`,

        { q: `Does a ${bankName} rejection hurt my CIBIL score?`, a: `The rejection itself is not reported to CIBIL. However, the hard inquiry made when you applied will lower your score by 5–10 points. Multiple rejections in a short period compound this damage.` },
